            "We are currently witnessing the dawn of the hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) economy, where H<sub>2</sub> will become a primary fuel for heating, transportation, and long-distance and long-term energy storage. Among the diverse possibilities, H<sub>2</sub> can be stored as a pressurized gas, cryogenic liquid, or solid fuel via adsorption onto porous materials. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as the adsorbent materials with the theoretical highest H<sub>2</sub> storage densities on both a volumetric and gravimetric basis. However, a critical bottleneck for the use of H<sub>2</sub> as a transportation fuel has been the lack of densification methods capable of shaping MOFs into practical formulations whilst maintaining their adsorptive performance. Here, we report a high-throughput screening and deep analysis of a database of MOFs to find optimal materials, followed by the synthesis, characterisation, and performance evaluation of an optimal monolithic MOF (<sub>mono</sub>MOF) for H<sub>2</sub> storage. After densification, this <sub>mono</sub>MOF stores 46 g L<sup>-1</sup> H<sub>2</sub> at 50 bar, 77 K, and delivers 41 and 42 g L<sup>-1</sup> H<sub>2</sub> at operating pressures of 25 and 50 bar, respectively, when deployed in a combined temperature–pressure (25-50 bar/77 K → 5 bar/160 K) swing gas delivery system. This performance represents up to an 80% reduction in the operating pressure requirements for delivering H<sub>2</sub> gas when compared with benchmark materials, and an 83% reduction compared to compressed H<sub>2</sub> gas. Our findings represent a substantial step forward in the application of high-density materials for volumetric H<sub>2</sub> storage applications.",

            "Porosity and surface area analysis play a prominent role in modern materials science, where their determination spans the fields of natural sciences, engineering, geology and medical research. At the heart of this sits the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory, which has been a remarkably successful contribution to the field of materials science. The BET method was developed in the 1930s and is now the most widely used metric for the estimation of surface areas of porous materials. Since the BET method was first developed, there has been an explosion in the field of nanoporous materials with the discovery of synthetic zeolites, nanostructured silicas, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs),and others. Despite its widespread use, the manual calculation of BET surface areas causes a significant spread in reported areas, resulting in reproducibility problems in both academia and industry. To probe this, we have brought together 60 labs with strong track records in the study of nanoporous materials. We provided eighteen adsorption isotherms and asked these researchers to calculate the corresponding BET areas, resulting in a wide range of values for each one. We show here that the reproducibility of BET area determination from identical isotherms is a largely ignored issue, raising critical concerns over the reliability of reported BET areas in the literature. To solve this major issue, we have developed a new computational approach to accurately and systematically determine the BET area of nanoporous materials. Our software, called BET Surface Identification (BETSI), expands on the well-known Rouquerol criteria and makes, for the first time, an unambiguous BET area assignment possible.",

Their inherently low mechanical stability, however, frequently renders existing methods of pelletisation ineffective contributing to pore collapse, pore blockage or insufficient densification of crystallites. Here, we present a general process for the shaping and densifying of COFs into centimetre-scale porous monolithic pellets without the need for templates, additives or binders. This process minimises mechanical damage from shear-induced plastic deformation and further provides a network of interparticle mesopores that we exploit in accessing analyte capacities above those achievable from the intrinsic porosity of the COF framework. Using a lattice-gas model, we accurately capture the monolithic structure across the mesoporous range and tie pore architecture to performance characteristics in both gas storage and separation applications. Collectively, these findings represent a substantial step in the practical applicability of COFs and other mechanically weak porous materials.",

            "The development of effective catalysts is one of the big challenges associated with a new circular carbon economy addressing climate change. The targeted synthesis of robust and recyclable catalysts can be made possible through elucidation of the molecular interactions between the active sites in metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with potentially reactive molecules. Herein, we present the use of lanthanide (Ln)-based MOFs – [Ln(HTCPB)] Ln: Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, Tb, and Dy; H<sub>4</sub>TCPB: 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)benzene – as catalysts for the conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to value-added products. Using these MOFs, we describe the fixation of CO<sub>2</sub> into the epoxy ring of propylene oxide for the production of cyclic carbonates. Structural analysis of the propylene oxide (PO)-loaded MOF revealed the binding of PO to Ce<sup>3+</sup>, confirming the key role of open Ce<sup>3+</sup> sites in reducing the activation energy of the PO chemical transformation. The ring-opening of the PO molecule is followed by the insertion of one molecule of CO<sub>2</sub>, leading to the formation of the propylene carbonate (PC) molecule. The channels present in the MOF structure allow for diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> from the environment to the open Ce<sup>3+</sup> sites and that of PC in the opposite direction, thus upholding the catalytic process. [Ce(HTCPB)] exhibited high catalytic activity toward PC production with a turn-over frequency (TOF) = 20.2 h<sup>−1</sup>, one of the highest reported. The catalyst showed no catalytic deterioration after three cycles and maintained a comparable catalytic activity when aqueous-rich conditions and gas CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> mixtures were used, highlighting that non-contributing gas molecules or impurities do not affect the catalytic activity of the MOF. Catalytic experiments using [Ln(HTCPB)] demonstrated that the rate of CO<sub>2</sub> conversion decreased by decreasing the ionic radii of the Ln used. Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations (GCMC) and topographic steric maps suggested that the activity of a catalyst can be tuned by manipulating the ionic size and partial charge of the lanthanides, and steric properties of the active site. Our study highlights the engineering of efficient catalysts capable of converting CO<sub>2</sub> into value-added products directly from its wet and mixed-composition streams (e.g., waste flue gas and biogas)",

This leads to the synthesis of two chiral hexahedral Pd<sub>6</sub>L<sub>12</sub> cages with crown ether or methoxymethyl moieties. Complexation of K<sup>+</sup> with crown ethers allows inclusion of anionic achiral boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes into the cage cavities to form stable host-guest complexes by cation-anion and host-guest interactions. Although both the cage and dyes exhibit no CPL, their host-guest complexes display strong CPL emissions with the g<sub>lum</sub> factors in the order of 10<sup>−3</sup> in solution. Upon crystallization, one order of magnitude amplification of the glum values in the cage-dye adducts (up to 2.4 × 10<sup>−2</sup>) is obtained.",

To solve this and other challenging gas separations, one requires a holistic approach. The complexity of a screening exercise for adsorption-based separations arises from the multitude of existing porous materials, including metal–organic frameworks. Besides, the multivariate nature of the performance criteria that needs to be considered when designing an optimal adsorbent and a separation process – i.e. an optimal material requires fulfillment of several criteria simultaneously – makes the screening challenging. To address this, we have developed a multi-scale approach combining high-throughput molecular simulation screening, data mining and advanced visualization, as well as process system modelling, backed up by experimental validation. We have applied our recent advances in the engineering of porous materials' morphology to develop advanced monolithic structures. These conformed, shaped monoliths can be used readily in industrial applications, bringing a valuable strategy for the development of advanced materials.

            "Metal–organic framework nanoparticles (nanoMOFs) have been widely studied in biomedical applications. Although substantial efforts have been devoted to the development of biocompatible approaches, the requirement of tedious synthetic steps, toxic reagents, and limitations on the shelf life of nanoparticles in solution are still significant barriers to their translation to clinical use. In this work, we propose a new postsynthetic modification of nanoMOFs with phosphate-functionalized methoxy polyethylene glycol (mPEG–PO3) groups which, when combined with lyophilization, leads to the formation of redispersible solid materials. This approach can serve as a facile and general formulation method for the storage of bare or drug-loaded nanoMOFs. The obtained PEGylated nanoMOFs show stable hydrodynamic diameters, improved colloidal stability, and delayed drug-release kinetics compared to their parent nanoMOFs. Ex situ characterization and computational studies reveal that PEGylation of PCN-222 proceeds in a two-step fashion. Most importantly, the lyophilized, PEGylated nanoMOFs can be completely redispersed in water, avoiding common aggregation issues that have limited the use of MOFs in the biomedical field to the wet form—a critical limitation for their translation to clinical use as these materials can now be stored as dried samples. The in vitro performance of the addition of mPEG–PO<sub>3</sub> was confirmed by the improved intracellular stability and delayed drug-release capability, including lower cytotoxicity compared with that of the bare nanoMOFs. Furthermore, z-stack confocal microscopy images reveal the colocalization of bare and PEGylated nanoMOFs. This research highlights a facile PEGylation method with mPEG–PO<sub>3</sub>, providing new insights into the design of promising nanocarriers for drug delivery.",

Traditional approaches to carbon capture involve corrosive and energy intensive processes such as liquid amine absorption. Although adsorptive separation has long been a promising alternative to traditions processes, to this point, there has been a lack of appropriate adsorbents capable to capturing CO<sub>2</sub> whilst maintaining low regeneration energies. In this context of CO<sub>2</sub> capture, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have gained much attention in the past two decades as potential materials. Their tuneable nature allows for exquisite control over pore size and chemistry, which allows for tailoring of their properties for selective adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub>. While many candidate materials exist, the amount of research into materials shaping for use in industrial processes has been limited. Traditional shaping strategies such as pelletisation involve the use of binders and/or mechanical processes, which can have a detrimental impact on the adsorption properties of the resulting materials or can result in low-density structures with low volumetric adsorption capacity. Herein, we demonstrate the use of a series of monolithic MOFs (<sub>mono</sub>UiO-66, <sub>mono</sub>UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub> & <sub>mono</sub>HKUST-1) for use in gas separation processes.",

However, its economic recovery is challenging and having a thorough molecular understanding of the heavy oil-rock interface will be advantageous. Here, we have used molecualr dynamics simulation tot probe the adhesion of heavy oil at commonly found carbonate (calcite), sandstone (silica), and clay (mica)-type rock reservoirs. The calcite surface has the highest adhesion energy with heavy oil followed by mica and silica surfaces. The dispersion interaction is dominant as compared to electrostatic interactions in calcite and silica systems. In contrast, an equal contribution of both interactions is found in the heavy oil-mica interface. The structure of heavy oil adjacent to the rock surface is characterized by a dense interfacial layer (IL) followed by a bulk zone. We found that the areal density of exposed atoms, roughness, and dipole moment of the rock surface has a significant effect on the structure of the IL and adhesion energy. A higher areal density of surface atoms coupled with low roughness leads to stronger adsorption of heavy oil molecules favored by dispersion interactions. The adsorption of aromatic carbon (from aromatic and resin fractions) of heavy oil is more than that of aliphatic carbons (from saturates) in the calcite and mica system, whereas a reverse trend is observed in the silica system. The charge distribution is non-uniform in the IL; however, the electrostatic interaction between the heavy oil and rock surface is dictated by the dipole moment of the rock surface",

Our force fields are based on cationic dummy models (CDMs). These dummy models simplify the methodology required to tune the parameters and improve the accuracy of the force fields. We used our force fields to compare mechanical properties across the M-MOF-74 series and determine that increasing the size of the linker decreases the framework rigidity. In addition, we applied our force fields to an extended linker analog of Mf-MOF-74 and characterized the free energy of a previously reported deformation pattern in which the one-dimensional hexagonal channels of the framework become irregular. The free energy profiles confirm that the deformation is adsorbate induced and impossible to access solely by a pressure stimulus. On the basis of our results, we conclude tha the force fields presented here and others that may be developed using our methodology are transferable across metal-organic framework series that share a metal center topology. Finally, we believe that these force fields have the potential to be adapted for the study of complex problems in MOF chemistry, including defects and crystal growth, that have thus far been beound the scope of classical molecular simulations.

Even though asphaltenes are known to behave as an emulsifying agent for emulsion formation, their arrangement at the oil-water interface is poorly understood. We investigated the effect of asphaltene structure (island type vs archipelago type) and heteroatom type (Oxygen-O, Nitrogen-N, and Sulfur-S) on their structural behavior in the oil-water system. Out of six asphaltenes studied here, only three asphaltenes remain at the oil-water interface while others are soluble in the oil phase. Molecular orientation of asphaltene at the interface, position, and angle of asphaltene with the interface has also been determined. We observed that the N-based archipelago type are perpendicular to the interface. These asphaltene molecules are anchored at the interface by the heteroatom. The S-based asphaltenes (both island and archipelago type) and O-based archipelago type asphaltenes are soluble in the oil phase due to their inability to form a hydrogen bond with water and steric crowding near the heteroatom. This study will help in understanding the role of asphaltenes in oil-water emulsion formation based on its structure and how to avoid it",

<!--            "The high packet rates handled by network appliances and similar software-based packet processing applications place a challenging load on caches such as flow caches. In these environments, both hit rate and cache hit latency are critical to throughput. Much recent work, however, has focused exclusively on one of these two desiderata, missing opportunities to further improve overall system throughput. This paper introduces Bounded Linear Probing (BLP), a new cache design optimized for network appliances. BLP works well across different workloads and cache sizes by balancing between hit rate and lookup latency. To accompany BLP, we also present a new, lightweight cache eviction policy called Probabilistic Bubble LRU that achieves near-optimal cache hit rate (assuming the algorithm is offline) without using any extra space. We make three main contributions: a theoretical analysis of BLP, a comparison between existing and proposed cache designs using microbenchmarks, and an end-to-end evaluation of BLP in the popular Open vSwitch (OvS) system. Our end-to-end experiments show that BLP is effective in practice: replacing the microflow cache in OvS with BLP improves throughput by up to 15%."-->
