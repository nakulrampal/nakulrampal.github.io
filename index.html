Our agent is built around a suite of large language models (LLMs) and is designed to eliminate human involvement in the evaluation process. Through extensive testing of various approaches such as DSPy and finetuning, among others, we found that the performance of a given LLM on these Q&A and synthesis conditions classification tasks is determined primarily by the architecture of the agent where it makes a significant difference how the different inputs are parsed and processed, and how the LLMs are called. We also found that the quality of the prompt provided remains paramount, irrespective of the sophistication of the underlying model. Even models considered state-of-the-art, such as GPT-o1, exhibit poor performance when the prompt lacks sufficient detail and structure. To overcome these challenges, we performed systematic prompt optimization, iteratively refining the prompt to significantly improve classification accuracy and achieve human-level evaluation benchmarks. We show that while LLMs have made remarkable progress, they still fall short of human reasoning without substantial prompt engineering. The agent presented here provides a robust and reproducible tool for evaluating Q&A pairs and synthesis conditions in a scalable manner and can serve as a foundation for future developments in automated evaluation of LLM inputs and outputs.",

Based on this strategy, we synthesized the highly sought after linear poly[n]catenanes with molecular weight of 4.5 megadaltons and degree of polymerization of 2,800—over 100 times higher than previous records. Generally, post-synthetic demetalation leads to non-crystalline solids; a challenge addressed by the in situ nature of phantom templation. This also allowed the installed anthracene units to organize through π-π stacking and chain-to-chain packing, giving single crystals of linear poly[n]catenanes as structurally determined by transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction techniques.",

There has been a long history of improving the efficiency of MD simulations through better numerical methods and, more recently, by utilizing machine learning (ML) methods. Yet, challenges remain, such as accurate modeling of extended-timescale simulations. To address this issue, we propose NeuralMD, the first ML surrogate that can facilitate numerical MD and provide accurate simulations in protein-ligand binding. We propose a principled approach that incorporates a novel physics-informed multi-grained group symmetric framework. Specifically, we propose (1) a BindingNet model that satisfies group symmetry using vector frames and captures the multi-level protein-ligand interactions, and (2) an augmented neural differential equation solver that learns the trajectory under Newtonian mechanics. For the experiment, we design ten single-trajectory and three multi-trajectory binding simulation tasks. We show the efficiency and effectiveness of NeuralMD, with a 2000× speedup over standard numerical MD simulation and outperforming all other ML approaches by up to ~80% under the stability metric. We further qualitatively show that NeuralMD reaches more stable binding predictions compared to other machine learning methods.",

The models evaluated include OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo, Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus, and Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro. Key results indicate that Claude excelled in providing complete synthesis data, while Gemini outperformed others in accuracy, characterization-free compliance(obedience), and proactive structuring of responses. Although GPT-4 was less effective in quantitative metrics, it demonstrated strong logical reasoning and contextual inference capabilities. Overall, Gemini and Claude achieved the highest scores in accuracy, groundedness, and adherence to prompt requirements, making them suitable benchmarks for future studies.

In this Perspective, we explore the concepts and methods used to apply LLMs in research, including prompt engineering, knowledge and tool augmentation and fne-tuning. We discuss how ‘chemistry-aware’ models can be tailored to specifc tasks and integrated into existing practices of reticular chemistry, transforming the traditional ‘make, characterize, use’ protocol driven by empirical knowledge into a discovery cycle based on fnding synthesis–structure–property–performance relationships. Furthermore, we explore how modular LLM agents can be integrated into multi-agent laboratory systems, such as self-driving robotic laboratories, to streamline labour-intensive tasks and collaborate with chemists and how LLMs can lower the barriers to applying generative artifcial intelligence and data-driven workfows to such challenging research questions as crystallization.

By tuning seed particles below 100 nm, we achieve highly crystalline, dense composites with up to 40% perovskite loading. Structural and optical characterization unveils perovskite nanocrystals forming within MOF mesopores, maximizing stability and preventing degradation, maintaining over 90% photoluminescence and structural integrity after weeks of exposure to humidity, heat, and solvents.

In this study, we demonstrate that GPT-4V, accessible through the ChatGPT web user interface or an API, offers promising possibilities in navigating and mining complex data for metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) especially from graphical sources (e.g. sorption isotherms, powder X-ray diffraction patterns, thermogravimetric analysis graphs, etc.). Our approach involved an automated process of converting 346 scholarly articles into 6240 images, which represents a benchmark dataset in this task, followed by deploying GPT-4V to categorize and analyze these images using natural language prompts, which can be written by chemists or materials scientists with minimal prior coding knowledge. This methodology enabled GPT-4V to accurately identify and interpret key plots integral to MOF characterization, such as nitrogen isotherms, PXRD patterns, and TGA curves, among others, with accuracy and recall above 93%. The model's proficiency in extracting critical information from these plots not only underscores its capability in data mining but also highlights its potential to aid in the digitalization of experimental data and the creation of datasets for reticular chemistry. In addition, the trends and values of nitrogen isotherm data from the selected literature allowed for a comparison between theoretical and experimental porosity values for over 200 compounds, highlighting certain discrepancies and underscoring the importance of integrating computational and experimental data.

Adsorbent-based HVAC technologies have long been touted as an energy-efficient alternative to traditional refrigeration systems. However, thus far, no suitable adsorbents have been developed which overcome the drawbacks associated with traditional sorbent materials such as silica gels and zeolites. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) offer order-of-magnitude improvements in water adsorption and regeneration energy requirements. However, the deployment of MOFs in HVAC applications has been hampered by issues related to MOF powder processing. Herein, three high-density, shaped, monolithic MOFs (UiO-66, UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub>, and Zr-fumarate) with exceptional volumetric gas/vapor uptake are developed—solving previous issues in MOF-HVAC deployment. The monolithic structures across the mesoporous range are visualized using small-angle X-ray scattering and lattice-gas models, giving accurate predictions of adsorption characteristics of the monolithic materials. It is also demonstrated that a fragile MOF such as Zr-fumarate can be synthesized in monolithic form with a bulk density of 0.76 g cm<sup>−3</sup> without losing any adsorption performance, having a coefficient of performance (COP) of 0.71 with a low regeneration temperature (≤ 100 °C)",

Here, we report a combinatorial strategy to make such nonclassic polyhedral cages by combining kinetically labile metal ions with non-planar organic linkers instead of the usual only inert metal centers and planar ligands. This facilitates the synthesis of an enantiopure twisted tetra(3-pyridyl)-based TADDOL (TADDOL = tetraaryl-1,3-dioxolane-4,5-dimethanol) ligand (<b>L</b>) capable of binding Ni(II) ions to produce a regular convex cage, Ni<sub>6</sub><b>L</b><sub>8</sub>, with two mixed metal/organic vertices and three rarely reported concave cages Ni<sub>14</sub><b>L</b><sub>8</sub>, Ni<sub>18</sub><b>L</b><sub>12</sub>, and Ni<sub>24</sub><b>L</b><sub>16</sub> with three or four mixed vertices. Each of the cages has an amphiphilic cavity decorated with chiral dihydroxyl functionalities and packs into a three-dimensional structure. The enantioselective adsorption and separation performances of the cages are strongly dependent on their pore structure features. Particularly, Ni<sub>14</sub><b>L</b><sub>8</sub> and Ni<sub>18</sub><b>L</b><sub>12</sub> with wide openings can be solid adsorbents for the adsorptive and solid-phase extractive separation of a variety of racemic spirodiols with up to 98% ee, whereas Ni<sub>6</sub><b>L</b><sub>8</sub> and Ni<sub>24</sub><b>L</b><sub>16</sub> with smaller pore apertures cannot adsorb the racemates. The combination of single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of the host–guest adduct and GCMC simulation indicates that the enantiospecific recognition capabilities originate from the well-organized chiral inner sphere as well as multiple interactions within the chiral microenvironment. This work therefore provides an attractive strategy for the rational design of polyhedral cages, showing geometrically fascinating structures with properties different from those of classic assemblies.",

Here, we present a general process for the shaping and densifying of COFs into centimetre-scale porous monolithic pellets without the need for templates, additives or binders. This process minimises mechanical damage from shear-induced plastic deformation and further provides a network of interparticle mesopores that we exploit in accessing analyte capacities above those achievable from the intrinsic porosity of the COF framework. Using a lattice-gas model, we accurately capture the monolithic structure across the mesoporous range and tie pore architecture to performance characteristics in both gas storage and separation applications.

Among the diverse possibilities, H<sub>2</sub> can be stored as a pressurized gas, cryogenic liquid, or solid fuel <i>via</i> adsorption onto porous materials. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as adsorbent materials with the highest theoretical H<sub>2</sub> storage densities on both a volumetric and gravimetric basis. However, a critical bottleneck for the use of H<sub>2</sub> as a transportation fuel has been the lack of densification methods capable of shaping MOFs into practical formulations whilst maintaining their adsorptive performance. Here, we report a high-throughput screening and deep analysis of a database of MOFs to find optimal materials, followed by the synthesis, characterisation, and performance evaluation of an optimal monolithic MOF (<sub>mono</sub>MOF) for H<sub>2</sub> storage. After densification, this <sub>mono</sub>MOF stores 46 g L<sup>-1</sup> H<sub>2</sub> at 50 bar, 77 K, and delivers 41 and 42 g L<sup>-1</sup> H<sub>2</sub> at operating pressures of 25 and 50 bar, respectively, when deployed in a combined temperature–pressure (25-50 bar/77 K → 5 bar/160 K) swing gas delivery system.

            "Porosity and surface area analysis play a prominent role in modern materials science. At the heart of this sits the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) theory, which has been a remarkably successful contribution to the field of materials science. The BET method was developed in the 1930s for open surfaces but is now the most widely used metric for the estimation of surface areas of micro- and mesoporous materials. Despite its widespread use, the calculation of BET surface areas causes a spread in reported areas, resulting in reproducibility problems in both academia and industry. To prove this, for this analysis, 18 already-measured raw adsorption isotherms were provided to sixty-one labs, who were asked to calculate the corresponding BET areas. This round-robin exercise resulted in a wide range of values. Here, the reproducibility of BET area determination from identical isotherms is demonstrated to be a largely ignored issue, raising critical concerns over the reliability of reported BET areas. To solve this major issue, a new computational approach to accurately and systematically determine the BET area of nanoporous materials is developed. The software, called “BET surface identification” (BETSI), expands on the well-known Rouquerol criteria and makes an unambiguous BET area assignment possible.",

The targeted synthesis of robust and recyclable catalysts can be made possible through elucidation of the molecular interactions between the active sites in metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with potentially reactive molecules. Herein, we present the use of lanthanide (Ln)-based MOFs – [Ln(HTCPB)] Ln: Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, Tb, and Dy; H<sub>4</sub>TCPB: 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)benzene – as catalysts for the conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to value-added products. Using these MOFs, we describe the fixation of CO<sub>2</sub> into the epoxy ring of propylene oxide for the production of cyclic carbonates. Structural analysis of the propylene oxide (PO)-loaded MOF revealed the binding of PO to Ce<sup>3+</sup>, confirming the key role of open Ce<sup>3+</sup> sites in reducing the activation energy of the PO chemical transformation. The ring-opening of the PO molecule is followed by the insertion of one molecule of CO<sub>2</sub>, leading to the formation of the propylene carbonate (PC) molecule. The channels present in the MOF structure allow for diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> from the environment to the open Ce<sup>3+</sup> sites and that of PC in the opposite direction, thus upholding the catalytic process. [Ce(HTCPB)] exhibited high catalytic activity toward PC production with a turn-over frequency (TOF) = 20.2 h<sup>−1</sup>, one of the highest reported. The catalyst showed no catalytic deterioration after three cycles and maintained a comparable catalytic activity when aqueous-rich conditions and gas CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> mixtures were used, highlighting that non-contributing gas molecules or impurities do not affect the catalytic activity of the MOF. Catalytic experiments using [Ln(HTCPB)] demonstrated that the rate of CO<sub>2</sub> conversion decreased by decreasing the ionic radii of the Ln used. Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations (GCMC) and topographic steric maps suggested that the activity of a catalyst can be tuned by manipulating the ionic size and partial charge of the lanthanides, and steric properties of the active site. Our study highlights the engineering of efficient catalysts capable of converting CO<sub>2</sub> into value-added products directly from its wet and mixed-composition streams (e.g., waste flue gas and biogas)",

            "The separation of CO/N<sub>2</sub> mixtures is a challenging problem in the petrochemical sector due to the very similar physical properties of these two molecules, such as size, molecular weight and boiling point. To solve this and other challenging gas separations, one requires a holistic approach. The complexity of a screening exercise for adsorption-based separations arises from the multitude of existing porous materials, including metal–organic frameworks. Besides, the multivariate nature of the performance criteria that needs to be considered when designing an optimal adsorbent and a separation process – i.e. an optimal material requires fulfillment of several criteria simultaneously – makes the screening challenging. To address this, we have developed a multi-scale approach combining high-throughput molecular simulation screening, data mining and advanced visualization, as well as process system modelling, backed up by experimental validation. We have applied our recent advances in the engineering of porous materials' morphology to develop advanced monolithic structures. These conformed, shaped monoliths can be used readily in industrial applications, bringing a valuable strategy for the development of advanced materials. This toolbox is flexible enough to be applied to multiple adsorption-based gas separation applications.",

            "Metal–organic framework nanoparticles (nanoMOFs) have been widely studied in biomedical applications. Although substantial efforts have been devoted to the development of biocompatible approaches, the requirement of tedious synthetic steps, toxic reagents, and limitations on the shelf life of nanoparticles in solution are still significant barriers to their translation to clinical use. In this work, we propose a new postsynthetic modification of nanoMOFs with phosphate-functionalized methoxy polyethylene glycol (mPEG–PO3) groups which, when combined with lyophilization, leads to the formation of redispersible solid materials. This approach can serve as a facile and general formulation method for the storage of bare or drug-loaded nanoMOFs. The obtained PEGylated nanoMOFs show stable hydrodynamic diameters, improved colloidal stability, and delayed drug-release kinetics compared to their parent nanoMOFs. Ex situ characterization and computational studies reveal that PEGylation of PCN-222 proceeds in a two-step fashion. Most importantly, the lyophilized, PEGylated nanoMOFs can be completely redispersed in water, avoiding common aggregation issues that have limited the use of MOFs in the biomedical field to the wet form—a critical limitation for their translation to clinical use as these materials can now be stored as dried samples. The in vitro performance of the addition of mPEG–PO<sub>3</sub> was confirmed by the improved intracellular stability and delayed drug-release capability, including lower cytotoxicity compared with that of the bare nanoMOFs. Furthermore, z-stack confocal microscopy images reveal the colocalization of bare and PEGylated nanoMOFs. This research highlights a facile PEGylation method with mPEG–PO<sub>3</sub>, providing new insights into the design of promising nanocarriers for drug delivery.",

            "Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is both a primary contributor to global warming and a major industrial impurity. Traditional approaches to carbon capture involve corrosive and energy intensive processes such as liquid amine absorption. Although adsorptive separation has long been a promising alternative to traditions processes, to this point, there has been a lack of appropriate adsorbents capable to capturing CO<sub>2</sub> whilst maintaining low regeneration energies. In this context of CO<sub>2</sub> capture, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have gained much attention in the past two decades as potential materials. Their tuneable nature allows for exquisite control over pore size and chemistry, which allows for tailoring of their properties for selective adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub>. While many candidate materials exist, the amount of research into materials shaping for use in industrial processes has been limited. Traditional shaping strategies such as pelletisation involve the use of binders and/or mechanical processes, which can have a detrimental impact on the adsorption properties of the resulting materials or can result in low-density structures with low volumetric adsorption capacity. Herein, we demonstrate the use of a series of monolithic MOFs (<sub>mono</sub>UiO-66, <sub>mono</sub>UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub> & <sub>mono</sub>HKUST-1) for use in gas separation processes.",

            "Heavy oil is an abundant and important energy source that has the potential to meet the increasing energy demand of the world. However, its economic recovery is challenging and having a thorough molecular understanding of the heavy oil-rock interface will be advantageous. Here, we have used molecualr dynamics simulation tot probe the adhesion of heavy oil at commonly found carbonate (calcite), sandstone (silica), and clay (mica)-type rock reservoirs. The calcite surface has the highest adhesion energy with heavy oil followed by mica and silica surfaces. The dispersion interaction is dominant as compared to electrostatic interactions in calcite and silica systems. In contrast, an equal contribution of both interactions is found in the heavy oil-mica interface. The structure of heavy oil adjacent to the rock surface is characterized by a dense interfacial layer (IL) followed by a bulk zone. We found that the areal density of exposed atoms, roughness, and dipole moment of the rock surface has a significant effect on the structure of the IL and adhesion energy. A higher areal density of surface atoms coupled with low roughness leads to stronger adsorption of heavy oil molecules favored by dispersion interactions. The adsorption of aromatic carbon (from aromatic and resin fractions) of heavy oil is more than that of aliphatic carbons (from saturates) in the calcite and mica system, whereas a reverse trend is observed in the silica system. The charge distribution is non-uniform in the IL; however, the electrostatic interaction between the heavy oil and rock surface is dictated by the dipole moment of the rock surface",

Our force fields are based on cationic dummy models (CDMs). These dummy models simplify the methodology required to tune the parameters and improve the accuracy of the force fields. We used our force fields to compare mechanical properties across the M-MOF-74 series and determine that increasing the size of the linker decreases the framework rigidity. In addition, we applied our force fields to an extended linker analog of Mf-MOF-74 and characterized the free energy of a previously reported deformation pattern in which the one-dimensional hexagonal channels of the framework become irregular. The free energy profiles confirm that the deformation is adsorbate induced and impossible to access solely by a pressure stimulus. On the basis of our results, we conclude tha the force fields presented here and others that may be developed using our methodology are transferable across metal-organic framework series that share a metal center topology. Finally, we believe that these force fields have the potential to be adapted for the study of complex problems in MOF chemistry, including defects and crystal growth, that have thus far been beound the scope of classical molecular simulations.

Even though asphaltenes are known to behave as an emulsifying agent for emulsion formation, their arrangement at the oil-water interface is poorly understood. We investigated the effect of asphaltene structure (island type vs archipelago type) and heteroatom type (Oxygen-O, Nitrogen-N, and Sulfur-S) on their structural behavior in the oil-water system. Out of six asphaltenes studied here, only three asphaltenes remain at the oil-water interface while others are soluble in the oil phase. Molecular orientation of asphaltene at the interface, position, and angle of asphaltene with the interface has also been determined. We observed that the N-based archipelago type are perpendicular to the interface. These asphaltene molecules are anchored at the interface by the heteroatom. The S-based asphaltenes (both island and archipelago type) and O-based archipelago type asphaltenes are soluble in the oil phase due to their inability to form a hydrogen bond with water and steric crowding near the heteroatom. This study will help in understanding the role of asphaltenes in oil-water emulsion formation based on its structure and how to avoid it",
